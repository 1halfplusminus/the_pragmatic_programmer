## Assertive Programming

### Use Assertions to prevent the impossible

> Whenever you find yourself thinking "but of course that could never happed." add code to check it.

```c
assert(result != null)
```

```java
assert result != null && result.size() > 0 : "Empty result from XYZ";
```

```c
books = my_sort(find("scifi"))
assert(is_sorted?(books))
```

Don't use assertions in place of real error handling example with IO

Assertions check for things that should never happen.

```c

puts("Enter `Y` or `N`")
ans = gets[0] # Grab first character of response
assert((ch == 'Y') || (ch == 'N')) # Very bad idea!

```

### Assertions and Side Effects

Don't use assertion if the condition has side effects.

```java

while(iter.hasMoreElements()) {
    assert(iter.nextElement() != null); // BAD: iter.nextElement() move the cursor of the iterator
    Object = obj = iter.nextElement();
}

```

### Leave assertions Turned On

### Exercise 16

Which of the "impossible" things can happen ?

- A month with fewer than 28 days -> possible
- Error code from a system call: can't access the current directory -> possible (lock, directory removed, permission error)
  
- In C++: a=2; b = 3; but (a+b) does not equal 5 -> possible
- A triangle with an interior angle sum = 180Â° -> possible
- A minute that doesn't have 60 seconds -> possible
- (a+1) <= a -> possible
